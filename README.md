Contains miscellaneous python projects which I have worked on

## How do I get set up?

### Windows Machine

1. Replace ```fileName``` with the name of the script you are trying to run and then execute the following commands:

   ```console
   python -m venv venv
   venv\scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python fileName.py
   ```

2. To exit the virtual environment use the command ```deactivate``` 

Alternatively it is possible to install the dependencies by using the requirements.txt included within this folder (example command below)

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
